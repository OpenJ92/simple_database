The general construction of a database comes in the following form:

   Tokenizer
-> Parser
-> CodeGenerator
-> VirtualMachine
-> B-Tree
-> Pager
-> OSInterface

Part One: Making a simple REPL
-- We defined a REPL function which initializes an InputBuffer
   with a char* to a stream and the buffer and input length. we then 
   enter a while loop that prints a unparameterized default output to
   the console and awaits user input via the read_input function. Upon
   updating the state of the InputBuffer, we carry out a string compare.
   
Part Two: World's simplest SQL compiler and Virtual Machine.
-- Refactor of REPL function to identify repl commands and eventually 
   SQL commands.
